To test, run the following command whilst in the directory where test.js resides:

mocha test.js

To use different report types, run the following command whilst in the directory where test.js resides:

mocha test.js -R list

Or

mocha test.js -R spec

NOTE: mocha needs to have been install globally as a node module in the root directory (where package.json resides). So run the following command in the root directory:

npm install -g mocha

P.S. You may have to be 'administrator', so in that case run:

sudo npm install -g mocha
